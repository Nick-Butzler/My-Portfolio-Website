    <h1>Cookie Policy for Nick Butzler's Website</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 05/29/2024</p>
    
    <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Nick Butzler ("I", "me", or "my") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit my website at <a href="http://www.nickbutzler.com">www.nickbutzler.com</a>. It explains what these technologies are and why I use them, as well as your rights to control my use of them.</p>
    
    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
    
    <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Nick Butzler) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., like advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
    
    <h2>Why do I use cookies?</h2>
    <p>I use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for my websites to operate, and I refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable me to track and target the interests of my users to enhance the experience on my websites. Third parties serve cookies through my websites for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
    
    <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
    <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</p>
    
    <p>The Cookie Consent Tool can be found at the footer of each web page. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>
